            <p>In 2013, the CDC released a study looking into fatal offshore injuries. They noted that someone working in the offshore oil and gas industry is 7 times more likely to die than other workers. As officially the most dangerous industry in the country, it is no surprise that maritime workers find themselves suffering from devastating, even life-altering injuries.</p>
            <p>As an injured maritime worker, you have special rights and ways to seek compensation, and you need the help of the best attorneys to win.</p>

                    looked at me as a person, as an individual who needs help, who needs guidance.
                    Kurt is the kind of person who won’t give up. If he is committed,
                    he will go for it. He won't back out."</blockquote>
